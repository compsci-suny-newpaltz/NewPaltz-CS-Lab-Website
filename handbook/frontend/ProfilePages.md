# ProfilePages
React component for the Profile Page, responsible for displaying and editing a user’s profile information. It begins by retrieving the id parameter from the URL using useParams, then sets up state variables to store the profile data, loading state, and edit mode. When the component loads, a useEffect hook triggers a call to the backend through the profileService, fetches the user's profile, and populates both the display state and the form state. The page supports two modes: a display mode, where the profile details are shown and the user can click an “Edit” button, and an editing mode, which presents input fields for modifying the profile information. Changes to form fields are handled by the handleChange function, while handleSave sends the updated data back to the server and refreshes the displayed profile. If the data is still loading or if no profile is found, the component displays appropriate messages.
